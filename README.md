# 4M20
Simulating crowd evacuation during fire. Based on Braitenberg Vehciles 2a and 2b.

run the main.m file to carry out different simulations

Each vehicle displays:
  1. Shortest route path planning if they know the building layout ("withInfo = true")
  2. Attraction to target door
  3. Avoidance of fire
  4. Avoidance of nearby agents
  5. Avoidance of nearby walls
  6. Communication about fire locations with others
  7. Unique speed
  8. Unique risk taking (affects the path planning)
  9. Health which decreases when in a room with fire
